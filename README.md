# Brody Billings Term 1 FIP

This is the submission file for first terms FIP for [Interactive Media Design](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/idp3-interactive-media-design/next#courses), at Fanshawe College. This website is based on a list of themes. The theme I selected was personal shoe/clothing collection. This website features photos taken by myself and code created with help from first term IDP.
